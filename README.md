⚡ Raspberry Pi Circuit Design & SPICE Simulation

This repository contains my personal projects while learning circuit design and SPICE simulation with Raspberry Pi.
It includes Qucs-S schematics, Ngspice simulations, and notes on filters, op-amps, and frequency analysis.

📘 Learning Content
✅ Designed and analyzed passive RC/RLC filters and measured their responses
✅ Built active filter and op-amp circuits and verified gain equations
✅ Practiced AC and transient analysis using Qucs-S with Ngspice backend
✅ Understood the basics of SPICE models and their internal structures
✅ Integrated simulated circuits into Raspberry Pi hardware experiments
